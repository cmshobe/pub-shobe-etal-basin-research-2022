## Quick guide to repository contents

- This repository contains all code and data required to reproduce all analyses in the paper linked above.
- The [paper figures](https://github.com/cmshobe/pub-shobe-etal-basin-research-2022/tree/main/paper_figures) folder simply contains jupyter notebooks that reproduce figures 3-10 and S1-S4.
- The [marine](https://github.com/cmshobe/pub-shobe-etal-basin-research-2022/tree/main/marine) folder contains all data and modeling scripts, as well as `marine_environment.yaml` which will build the appropriate computing environment. Note that while all analyses can be conducted on a laptop/desktop machine, it is wise to use an HPC for inversion exercises if possible.
